Evaluating Recommender Output
=============================

LensKit's evaluation support is based on post-processing the output of recommenders
and predictors.  The `batch utilities`_ provide support for generating these outputs.

We generally recommend using Jupyter_ notebooks for evaluation.

When writing recommender system evaluation results for publication, it's
important to be precise about how exactly your metrics are being computed
:cite:p:`Tamm2021-hz`; to aid with that, each metric function's documentation
includes a mathematical definition of the metric.

Saving and Loading Outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In our own experiments, we typically store the output of recommendation runs in LensKit
experiments in CSV or Parquet files, along with whatever parameters are relevant from
the configuration.
