Evaluating Recommender Output
=============================

LensKit's evaluation support is based on post-processing the output of
recommenders and predictors.  The `batch utilities`_ provide support for
generating these outputs.

We generally recommend using Jupyter_ notebooks for evaluation.

When writing recommender system evaluation results for publication, it's
important to be precise about how exactly your metrics are being computed
:cite:p:`tammQualityMetricsRecommender2021`; to aid with that, each metric
function's documentation includes a mathematical definition of the metric.
