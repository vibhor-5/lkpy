Algorithm Implementation Tips
=============================

Implementing algorithms is fun, but there are a few things that are good to keep in mind.

In general, development follows the following:

1. Correct
2. Clear
3. Fast

In that order.  Further, we always want LensKit to be *usable* in an easy fashion.  Code
implementing algorithms, however, may be quite complex in order to achieve good performance.
