Algorithm Interfaces
====================

.. module:: lenskit

LKPY's batch routines and utility support for managing algorithms expect algorithms
to implement consistent interfaces.  This page describes those interfaces.

The interfaces are realized as abstract base classes with the Python :py:mod:`abc` module.
Implementations must be registered with their interfaces, either by subclassing the interface
or by calling :py:meth:`abc.ABCMeta.register`.

Serialization
-------------

Like SciKit models, all LensKit algorithms are pickleable, and this is how we
recommend saving models to disk for later use.  This can be done with
:py:mod:`pickle`, but we recommend using :py:mod:`binpickle` for more
automatically-optimized storage.  For example, to save a fully-configured ALS
module with fairly aggressive ZSTD compression::

    algo = Recommender.adapt(ImplicitMF(50))
    algo.fit(ratings)
    binpickle.dump(algo, binpickle.codecs.Blosc('zstd', 9))

Base Algorithm
--------------

Algorithms follow the SciKit fit-predict paradigm for estimators, except they
know natively how to work with Pandas objects.

The :py:class:`Algorithm` interface defines common methods.

Recommendation
--------------

The :py:class:`Recommender` interface provides an interface to generating
recommendations.  Not all algorithms implement it; call
:py:meth:`Recommender.adapt` on an algorithm to get a recommender for any
algorithm that at least implements :py:class:`Predictor`.  For example::

    pred = Bias(damping=5)
    rec = Recommender.adapt(pred)

If the algorithm already implements :py:class:`Recommender`, it is returned, so
it is safe to always call :py:meth:`Recommender.adapt` before fitting an
algorithm you will need for top-*N* recommendations to mak sure it is suitable.

Candidate Selection
-------------------

Some recommenders use a *candidate selector* to identify possible items to
recommend. These are also treated as algorithms, mainly so that they can
memorize users' prior ratings to exclude them from recommendation.

Rating Prediction
-----------------

The :py:class:`Predictor` class impelemnts ‘rating prediction’, as well as any
other personalized item scoring that may not be predictions of actual ratings.
Most algorithms actually implement this interface.
