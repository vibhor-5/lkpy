LensKit is a set of Python tools for experimenting with and studying recommender
systems.  It provides support for training, running, and evaluating recommender
algorithms in a flexible fashion suitable for research and education.

Python LensKit (LKPY) is the successor to the Java-based LensKit project.

## Installing

To install the current release with Anaconda (recommended):

    conda install -c lenskit lenskit

Or you can use `pip`:

    pip install lenskit

To use the latest development version, install directly from GitHub:

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/lenskit/lkpy

Then see [Getting Started](https://lkpy.lenskit.org/en/latest/GettingStarted.html)

## Developing

To contribute to LensKit, clone or fork the repository, get to work, and submit a pull request.  We welcome contributions from anyone; if you are looking for a place to get started, see the [issue tracker](https://github.com/lenskit/lkpy/issues).

We recommend using an Anaconda environment for developing LensKit.  To set this up, run:

    conda env create -f dev-environment.yml

This will create a Conda environment called `lkpy-dev` with the packages required to develop and test LensKit.
