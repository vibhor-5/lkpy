LensKit is a set of Python tools for experimenting with and studying recommender
systems.  It provides support for training, running, and evaluating recommender
algorithms in a flexible fashion suitable for research and education.

LensKit for Python (LKPY) is the successor to the Java-based LensKit project.

[release]: https://lkpy.lenskit.org/en/stable/

## Installing

To install the current release with Anaconda (recommended):

    conda install -c conda-forge lenskit

If you use Pixi, you can add it to your project:

    pixi add lenskit

Or you can use `pip`:

    pip install lenskit

To use the latest development version, install directly from GitHub:

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/lenskit/lkpy

Then see [Getting Started](https://lkpy.lenskit.org/en/stable/GettingStarted.html)

## Developing

[issues]: https://github.com/lenskit/lkpy/issues
[workflow]: https://github.com/lenskit/lkpy/wiki/DevWorkflow

To contribute to LensKit, clone or fork the repository, get to work, and submit
a pull request.  We welcome contributions from anyone; if you are looking for a
place to get started, see the [issue tracker][issues].

Our development workflow is documented in [the wiki][workflow]; the wiki also
contains other information on *developing* LensKit. User-facing documentation is
at <https://lkpy.lenskit.org>.

[conda-lock]: https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-lock
[lkdev]: https://github.com/lenskit/lkdev

We recommend using Pixi for developing LensKit.  Our `pixi.toml` file contains
the development dependencies; to instal l dependencies for all of the LensKit
packages (on Linux or macOS), use the `dev-full` environment:

```console
$ pixi install -e dev-full
```

You can use `pixi shell` to open a shell within this environment:

```console
$ pixi shell -e dev-full
```

If you are on Windows, use `dev-core` instead of `dev-full`; some LensKit
packages will be missing dependencies (specifically Implicit, HPF, and FunkSVD).

## Testing Changes

You should always test your changes by running the LensKit test suite:

    python -m pytest

If you want to use your changes in a LensKit experiment, you can locally install
your modified LensKit into your experiment's environment.  We recommend using
separate environments for LensKit development and for each experiment; you will
need to install the modified LensKit into your experiment's repository:

    conda activate my-exp
    conda install -c conda-forge
    cd /path/to/lkpy
    pip install -e . --no-deps

You may need to first uninstall LensKit from your experiment repo; make sure that
LensKit's dependencies are all still installed.

Once you have pushed your code to a GitHub branch, you can use a Git repository as
a Pip dependency in an `environment.yml` for your experiment, to keep using the
correct modified version of LensKit until your changes make it in to a release.
