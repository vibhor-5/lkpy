LensKit is a set of Python tools for experimenting with and studying recommender
systems.  It provides support for training, running, and evaluating recommender
algorithms in a flexible fashion suitable for research and education.

LensKit for Python (LKPY) is the successor to the Java-based LensKit project.

## Installing

To install the current release with Anaconda (recommended):

    conda install -c lenskit lenskit

Or you can use `pip`:

    pip install lenskit

To use the latest development version, install directly from GitHub:

    pip install -U git+https://github.com/lenskit/lkpy

Then see [Getting Started](https://lkpy.lenskit.org/en/latest/GettingStarted.html)

## Developing

[issues]: https://github.com/lenskit/lkpy/issues
[workflow]: https://github.com/lenskit/lkpy/wiki/DevWorkflow

To contribute to LensKit, clone or fork the repository, get to work, and submit
a pull request.  We welcome contributions from anyone; if you are looking for a
place to get started, see the [issue tracker][].

Our development workflow is documented in [the wiki][workflow]; the wiki also
contains other information on *developing* LensKit. User-facing documentation is
at <https://lkpy.lenskit.org>.


We recommend using an Anaconda environment for developing LensKit.  To set this
up, run:

    pip install flit_core packaging
    python build-tools/flit-conda.py --create-env --python-version 3.8

This will create a Conda environment called `lkpy` with the packages required to develop and test
LensKit.

We don't maintain the Conda environment specification directly - instead, we
maintain information in `setup.toml` to be able to generate it, so that we define
dependencies and versions in one place.  The `flit-conda` package uses Flit's
configuration parser to load this data and generate Conda environment files.
