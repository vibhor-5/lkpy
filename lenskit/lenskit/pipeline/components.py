    Interface (protocol) for pipeline components: functions from inputs to outputs.

    * :class:`ConfigurableComponent`
    * :class:`TrainableComponent`

        This protocol is equivalent to ``Callable[..., COut]`` but is defined as a
        protocol so we can define sub-protocols with additional methods.

            The protocol definition allows arbitrary keyword arguments (and no
            positional arguments), to work with Python's type system limitations
            and the impossibility of manually writing :class:`~typing.ParamSpec`
            declarations, but component implementations are expected to declare
            specific input arguments with type annotations.

    A component must implement both of these methods to be considered
    configurable.
