"""
Pydantic models for LensKit data schemas.  These models define define the data
schema in memory and also define how schemas are serialized to and from
configuration files.  See :ref:`data-model` for details.

.. note::

    The schema does not specify data types directly â€” data types are inferred
    from the underlying Arrow data structures.  This reduces duplication of type
    information and the opportunity for inconsistency.
